        <p>The biggest problem during space travel is mental stress. Our solution to mental stress is AIVRS, Artificial Intelligence Virtual Reality System. Mental stress is caused by the extreme isolation on in space, and by the lack of human life. Our solution can solve both of those problems. Virtual reality plays a big part in this solution. First the astronaut puts on the VR goggles, then he will see any kind of nature landscape. Not only that, but the astronaut can also move around using an omni board(a treadmill that can go all directions). Now also using the VR goggles, the astronaut can see his family or loved ones. This is where the AI comes in, the programmer of the VR can programm AI into the program, allowing the astronaut to see his family, friends, and loved ones. We have went to some places to lean more and to share our idea. We have went to a nursing home called Prestige care & rehab of reedwood, a hospital named The Adventist medical group and been to a HP VR lab in Oregon.</p>
